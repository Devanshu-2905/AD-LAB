                    <strong>1. Smart Weather Monitoring System Using IoT</strong> - This project involves building a weather monitoring system that measures environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, air pressure, and air quality (e.g., CO2 and VOC levels). Using sensors like DHT22 and BMP280, the data is collected and transmitted to a cloud platform like Firebase using an ESP32. The system allows users to monitor weather conditions in real time through a smartphone app or a web dashboard. This project is ideal for learning IoT, sensor interfacing, and cloud communication.

                    <strong>2. Obstacle Avoidance Robot Using Ultrasonic Sensors</strong> - This project focuses on creating an autonomous robot that can navigate its environment while avoiding obstacles. It uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in the robot's path and a microcontroller like Arduino or ESP32 to process the sensor data. Based on the distance from the obstacle, the robot adjusts its direction using DC motors controlled via an L298N motor driver. This project teaches robotics, sensor integration, and motor control, making it great for beginners interested in robotics.

            <p><strong>Summer Training</strong> - C-DOT New Delhi (May - July 2024)</p>
            <p><strong>Frame Boundary Detection and Frames in Communication Systems</strong> - Frames in communication systems are structured units of data containing a header (metadata), payload (actual data), and trailer (error-checking codes) to ensure reliable transmission. Frame boundary detection identifies the start and end of frames, preventing errors and ensuring synchronization. Common methods include bit stuffing (special markers), byte counting (payload length), character-based framing (specific symbols), and clock and data recovery (precise timing). These techniques are essential for accurate data interpretation in systems like Ethernet and Wi-Fi.</p>
